"""The GPS tether: NMEA made from gpsd's JSON, served on loopback.  D-061.

Moved here from Hammunition's ``src/hammunition/gps_tether.py`` (the first
commit names the origin); the D-numbers are the engine's, in its DECISIONS.md.

QMapShack has no gpsd client. Its Realtime source *GPS TCP/IP* (the source list's "Add source") reads NMEA (RMC
and GGA) from a TCP host. The first tether piped ``gpspipe -r`` through ``socat``.
On the bench on 2026-09-29, with it connected, no NMEA reached the client;
gpsd's JSON watch was sending no TPV at the same time (``?POLL`` answered
``active: 0``), so no cause for that silence is established, and
``gpspipe(1)`` says ``-r`` emits pseudo-NMEA built from binary data. This
version stands on its own: no socat or gpspipe, the loopback bind made and
tested in code, sentences built from the JSON feed every gpsd client (xgps,
Navit) reads, and a plain message when gpsd has no fix. It asks gpsd for
JSON itself, ``?WATCH={"enable":true,"json":true}`` on
127.0.0.1 port 2947, and writes ``$GPRMC`` and ``$GPGGA`` for every ``TPV``
with a 2D or 3D fix. A field gpsd did not give is an empty field, with one
exception: a TPV with no time (or one that does not parse) is stamped with
the system clock in UTC, because a reader may drop a sentence without one.

It listens on 127.0.0.1 port 10110, the conventional NMEA-0183 port, or
another port the operator names, and on loopback only whatever the port: a
position is where the operator is, it is served without authentication, and
it is not served to the network. Another machine reaches it through
``ssh -L``. gpsd may be on this machine or another (a Pi, a phone, a shack
computer). Any number of clients may connect at once, and each receives
every sentence (fan-out): one gpsd watch is opened when the first client
connects, shared while any is connected, and closed when the last leaves,
so every client gets the same bytes and gpsd is not watched while nobody
listens. A client that stops reading is dropped alone. It runs as the
operator, never as root: in a terminal until Ctrl-C, or as the user service
``systemd/hammunition-gps-tether.service`` this project ships (the engine
installs it); either way it is the standard library only. Navit needs none of
this: it reads gpsd itself.

With ``--nmea-socket PATH`` (D-069) it also listens on a unix stream socket,
mode 0660, in the group GeoClue runs as, and serves it exactly what it serves
TCP: the same sentences from the same gpsd watch, with the same rules for a
client that stops reading or goes. GeoClue's network-NMEA source reads it, and
CoMaps reads GeoClue. ``hardware apply`` makes the setgid directory the socket
lives in; the socket is removed when the tether stops.
